Atiśa tibet

7 points of 

3 prelimanieris
1. Truth is not something to be created. Truth is not far away. Truth is here now.
Truth sourrounds you. Like the ocean surroends the fish. Fish may not be aware.
Once the fish becomes aware of the ocean the fish becomes enlightened. 
Fish born in the ocean. Always lived in it. Part of the ocean. 
To know ocean a little distance is needed.
Because god is not far away. But very close by. You are it. He is within you and without you.
This is the first thing. Truth already is. We are in it.
Not discover it. It is not covered. All that is needed is awareness in you.
You are not alert. You dont know how to watch.

2. Mind is the barrier. Just your own mind. Surrounds you like a movie goes on and on.
Fascinated by it. Fantasy that surrounds you. Continuous story. 
Mind is composed of dreams. Desires. State of mind is like these but surrounds you.

3. No mind is the door.
Budhecidda. Budha-mind.Mind without content. Mind without heart. 
Not dreams. Not thinks but aware. 

Think that all phenomena as dreams.
All that you see. Experienced. Objects of the world, and objects of mind 
spiritual experiences too. Beautiful dream. Great light. It is also phenomenon.
You are always seer never the seen.
Experiencer not the experienced.
witness not the witnessed. Material, psycological, spiritual all phenomenon.
Powerfull technique. Walk on street people are dreams, shops, customers. 
Suddendly you realize i am too a dream
ego slips. meditate this way. ego is byproduct of thinking phonemane real.
in dream remember this is dream too. and dream disappear.
eyes clear. everything colorfull alive. existance quality.
object looses objectivity , subject looses subjectivity

4. Examine this state of awareness. unbound awareness. No objects subjects. Purity.
Look deep into it. it is timeless. eveeything is dream.smile laughs. 
life is ridiculous. absurd. unecceraliy suffering. nightmare was your own creating.

5. let the remedy itself go. last temtetion. once more mind tries. one effort to cling to the method.
"all phenomena is a dream" is a metod gave you such joy. deep experience of reality. same old thing.
mind is back if you cling. depend on anything, posess anything mind is back. money or method you posses by it
afraid to loose it.Once you attain drop the method. Method is a boat. Use it and let it go.

Not loose yourself in preliminaries and methods. Many loose. Many afraid of entering.
Settle of basic cognition. 

Every phenomena is a phantom. 
Breath. Take all the misery ow wourd absorbed in your hearth pour hapiness. Cure.
